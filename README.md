## 🚨 CRITICAL SETUP STEP

**If you see the error `'next' is not recognized`, it means you haven't installed dependencies yet.**

Run this command immediately:

```bash
npm install
```

After installation finishes, start the app:

```bash
vercel dev
# or
npm run dev
```

## 🧹 Cleanup
The following files are from the previous version of the app and should be deleted to prevent conflicts:
- `index.html`
- `index.tsx`
- `App.tsx`
- `metadata.json`

## 🏗️ Architecture
- **Framework**: Next.js 15 (App Router)
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS
- **Database**: Supabase
